  <h2>Explanation of K-Energy Series</h2>
  <p>In Korea, why is everybody always telling one another to keep ‘fighting’? In Korean, the English word ‘fighting’ (pronounced ‘pa-i-ting’) is a common term of encouragement, which might be uttered to a coworker who has to work late or a classmate who is studying for an entrance exam. In a society where adults work some of the longest hours in the world and children attend after-school academies until late at night, the ubiquity of this word is no surprise. However, I feel it is important to challenge the taken-for-grantedness of this word and explore the possibility of new relationships with ‘effort’ and ‘hard work’ in Korean society.</p>
  <p>Walking the streets of Seoul, I catch glimpses of other people’s lives. I can’t help but notice scattered leaflets and other things crying out for my attention. Walking the streets, some things fit into neat categories in the mind whereas others don’t. Whenever I see a discarded Bacchus bottle, I always end up thinking about the fact that somebody drank that energy drink for some reason at some time and place.</p>
  <p>Why are we always working ourselves to exhaustion? We have all heard it: ‘I worked for X hours today.’ ‘I only slept X hours last night.’ ‘I stayed out all night.’ Why are we always ‘fighting’ so hard? It’s as if we are addicted to this type of life and way of thinking.</p>
  <p>I’m going for a walk again, and it's my eyes which lead the way, not my feet. I’m searching for brown Bacchus bottles. Suddenly, my phone vibrates. Thinking it will stop, I ignore it. It doesn’t stop. I quickly check my phone, but it’s nothing important. Thanks to social networks, we are constantly being updated on other people’s lives. We are bombarded with information constantly. It feels like notifications are always set to on. Sometimes messaging apps on my phone remind me of my parents who constantly bursted into my room without knocking.</p>
  <p>My three artworks <i><strong>#energetickorea</strong></i>, <i><strong>K-Energy</strong></i>, and <i><strong>Energetic Korea (working title)</strong></i> feature images which represent our obsession with hard work in an effort to clarify the position of ‘fighting’ culture in South Korean society. My work #energetickorea gathers together images of Bacchus bottles discarded on the street in photographs. I then share these images on Instagram under the hashtag #energetickorea. <i><strong>K-Energy</strong></i> is a video piece which tells the story of a day in the life of South Korea’s ‘fIghting’ culture using the familiar device of a smartphone, an object which mediates our online and offline worlds. Finally, in an attempt to overcome the confines of the art world and connect more broadly with audiences, I export the images of the Bacchus characters from K-Energy to produce emoticons to be shared in the real world through my work <i><strong>Energetic Korea (working title)</strong></i>.
